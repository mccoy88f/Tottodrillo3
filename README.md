## 📚 Source Development

Tottodrillo supports three types of sources:

1. **API Sources**: HTTP REST API endpoints (like CrocDB)
2. **Java/Kotlin Sources**: Local Java/Kotlin code execution
3. **Python Sources**: Local Python script execution (using Chaquopy)

For detailed documentation on creating sources, see the [Tottodrillo-Source repository](https://github.com/mccoy88f/Tottodrillo-Source):
- [🇮🇹 Italian Guide](https://github.com/mccoy88f/Tottodrillo-Source/blob/main/SOURCE_DEVELOPMENT.md)
- [🇬🇧 English Guide](https://github.com/mccoy88f/Tottodrillo-Source/blob/main/SOURCE_DEVELOPMENT_EN.md)

### Quick Start

1. Create a ZIP package with:
   - `source.json` - Source metadata (required)
   - `platform_mapping.json` - Platform code mapping (required)
   - `api_config.json` - API configuration (for API sources)
   - Python script or JAR file (for Python/Java sources)

2. Install the source via Settings → Sources → Install Source

3. Enable the source and start using it!

See the documentation files for complete examples and API details.

## 🌐 Localization

The app currently supports 8 languages:
- 🇮🇹 Italian (default)
- 🇬🇧 English
- 🇪🇸 Spanish
- 🇩🇪 German
- 🇯🇵 Japanese
- 🇫🇷 French
- 🇨🇳 Simplified Chinese
- 🇵🇹 Portuguese

The app automatically uses the device's language. If the language is not supported, it defaults to Italian.
